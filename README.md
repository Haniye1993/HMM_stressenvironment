# Hidden Markov Model Inference Comparison

This project demonstrates and compares different inference methods in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM),
including filtering, smoothing, and Viterbi decoding.

A Gaussian HMM with fixed parameters is used to simulate observations under different conditions
such as overlapping emissions, degenerate likelihoods, and slow state transitions.

The goal is to illustrate how inference methods behave and fail under stress scenarios.
